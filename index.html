          This website contains links to my github repositories of personal and study related codes and projects to demonstrate a selection of my skills in GIS, Data Science and coding.<br> 
	  I work full time as an IT Support Engineer and working towards a career change as a Data Scientist or GIS Analyst. I am studying for my MSc in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) <br> via distance learning with the University Of Leeds
	  (https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/msc-in-gis-via-odl/) and doing a Data Science Bootcamp with Cambridge Spark (https://cambridgespark.com/).

	       interacting with each other and resources within their environment by eating, collecting and storing

	  <h4>Implemented in Jupyter notebook to show the scale of deaths in the Black Death of 1665. The plague was attributed to fleas from

		  It outputs the average weekly death and total weekly death and also a map for the average weekly death.

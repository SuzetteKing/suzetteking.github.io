          This website contains codes and projects to demonstrate a selection of skills that I have developed from my current studies. 
	  I am studying for my MSc in <br> Geographical Information Systems (GIS) via distance learning with the University Of Leeds
	  (https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/msc-in-gis-via-odl/) <br> and doing a bootcamp
	in Data Science with Cambridge Spark (https://cambridgespark.com/).
